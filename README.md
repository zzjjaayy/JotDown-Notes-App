:bulb: 
I started this app following a course on Udemy by @stevdza-san to learn the basics of data persistence and room library. 
This is NOT JUST a clone and I have played with the code to my heart's content adding extra stuff like archive with an extra entity in the DB and a UI overhaul with splash and onboarding screens and much more.

### The technological aspect of it â†’

- This is a native android application made using ***Kotlin***.
- The application is using the ***MVVM architecture principles***. [I tried following them but its far from clean]
- Uses ***Room library*** for the DB operations.
